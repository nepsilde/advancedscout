            <h1>WHAT IS SCOUTING ?</h1>
            <p>Scouting is a journey not a destination. There is always going to be new things that you can
                learn as a scout and those things are very useful in our practical life. There are different
                events that happen in scout that teaches and conveys a good message. Not only programs but
                there are also different games that are both fun and interesting to play but it conveys a
                good message.
                The importance of scout are as follows:
                1. It provides service to others.
                2. Hiking and camping is done in well-mannered and disciplined way.
                3. It teaches us new things.
                4. Scouting is more fun and interesting informal education.
                An example of a game:
                catch the tail: In this game a scarf is put in your backside of your pant and left to hang,
                this is your tail. You can catch and pull the tail of all your friends and who has a tail
                wins this game. But if we donâ€™t pull any ones tail all our friends can win because there is
                no statement that has been said that there can be only one winner. So, this game teaches us
                friendship and unity.
                An example of a program:
                Camp: A camp is one of the most important programs of a scout because it teaches us survival
                in the wilderness and it provides scouts with different level of badges and other rewards
                for our actions.</p>
